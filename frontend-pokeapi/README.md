# Creating a state management system based on Zustand.

This is a simple React project that demonstrates the concept of a state manager based on Zustand, utilizing observables and the `useSyncExternalStore` hook. This example project showcases how you can efficiently manage application state with this approach.

## Getting Started

To run this example project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-zustand-observable-example.git
    cd react-zustand-observable-example
  ```
2. **Install the dependencies**:

  ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn
  ```

3. **Start the development server**:
  ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
  ```

3. **Open your web browser** and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to see the example in action

## How It Works
This project creates a simple React application that recreat the basic function of Zustand state management. It includes a basic todo component and emulate login that demonstrates the use of observables and the useSyncExternalStore hook. Here's how it's structured:

`*` src/store/createStore.ts: Create the basic structure of the createStore function.

`*` src/components/: Here are all the components we created to simulate React renders.
